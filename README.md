# App Idea: Safe Bubbles - Community Assistance Locator

## Problem Statement: 

During times of crisis, such as natural disasters or public health emergencies, communities often need quick access to essential resources and assistance. Many people want to help their neighbors but lack a streamlined way to offer or request assistance.

## App Concept: 

Safe Bubbles is a web app (potentially mobile) designed to facilitate community support during emergencies and times of need.

## Features:

- User Profiles: Users can create profiles with their basic information, location, and a list of assistance they can offer (e.g., food, water, shelter, transportation, medical aid).

- Request Assistance: Individuals in need can create requests for specific types of assistance. For instance, someone can request water, a place to stay, or transportation to a nearby shelter.

- View Map: A map displays user profiles, requests, and available resources. Users can see who needs help and who can provide it within their vicinity.

- AI Assitant: A chatbox connected to AI for user assistance

## To be implemented:

- Real-time Notifications: Users receive real-time push notifications when someone nearby needs assistance or offers help.

- Secure Messaging: Users can communicate securely through an in-app messaging system to coordinate assistance.

- Verification and Trust: Implement a simple user verification system to ensure the authenticity and trustworthiness of users offering help.

## Impact:

Encourages a sense of community and mutual support during difficult times.
